# Ask the user to decide which operator to used
# Use the try and except function to check error when asking what operator to use
# Add condition when the user inputted an invalid number

# Ask the user for the two integers then assign them into variables 
# Call the add function if the user choose 1
# Call the subtract function if the user choose 2
# Call the multiply function if the user choose 3
# Call the divide function if the user choose 4 

# Use the except ValueError and TypeError if the user entered the wrong values

# Use an else statement if the user entered an integer greater than 4
# Use the except ValueError and TypeError if the user entered the wrong values

# Define a function which is the sum, which will add the two inputted numbers
# Define a function which is the subtraction, which will subtract the two inputted numbers
# Define a function which is the multiplication, which will multiply the two inputted numbers
# Define a function which is the divison, which will divide the two inputted numbers
# Use the except ZeroDivisionError if the user divided by zero
# Call for the function display menu

# While loop for the program to continue unless the user stops it
# Ask the user if he/she wants to continue
# Continue the program
# Stop the program
# If what the user inputted is invalid then he/she will be asked to try again
